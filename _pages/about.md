I am a second-year PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Michigan.
I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in ECE from the National Taiwan University, 
during which I was advised by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).
My research interests are formal verification,
and I am currently exploring interactive theorem proving and programming languages for formal verification.
In the past, I have worked on software/hardware model checking and satisfiability (SAT, QBF, SMT).
