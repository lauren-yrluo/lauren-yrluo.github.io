I am a second-year CSE PhD student at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Karem Sakallah](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~karem/).
I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in ECE from the National Taiwan University, 
during which I was advised by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).

Research Interest
======
My research interests are formal verification, automated reasoning, and computational logic. In particular,
**Formal verification.**
I am generally interested in software/hardware formal verification.
My current research applies automated reasoning techniques to verify safety properties of distributed protocols. 
In the past, I have worked on hardware model checking. 
**Automated reasoning.**
I am also interested in developing high performance software for automated reasoning. 
I have worked on topics related to SAT/QBF solving.
**Computational logic**
Besides developing algorithms,
I am also interested in proof systems and proof complexities so as to understand what makes an algorithm work well in practice despite the problem's complexity

Welcome to take a look at my publication list for more information about my research.
To me, the most wonderful apsect of research is building solutions to real-world challenges upon fundamental basis and understanding them.
I would also be very happy to meet friends with common research interests.
