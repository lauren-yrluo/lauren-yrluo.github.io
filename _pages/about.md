I am a second-year CSE PhD student at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Karem Sakallah](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~karem/).
I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in ECE from the National Taiwan University, 
during which I was advised by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).

Research Interest
======
My research interests and areas are formal verification, automated reasoning, and computational logic.
For me, the most wonderful of my research is building solutions to real-world challenges upon fundamental basis and understanding them.
Hence, I am interested in both theories and practice of formal methods. Specifically, 

** Formal verification **
My current research applies automated reasoning techniques to verify safety properties of distributed protocols. 
In the past, I have worked on hardware model checking. 
I am generally interested in scaling automated formal verification for human designed systems.
In the future,
I would also like to explore interactive theorem proving for formal verification.

** Automated reasoning **
I am also interested in developing high performance software for automated reasoning. 
I have worked on topics related to SAT/QBF solving and I am still following research advances in the SAT community.

** Computational logic **
Besides developing algorithms,
I am also interested in understanding what makes an algorithm work well in practice despite the problem's complexity.
Hence, I am interested in proof systems and proof complexities. 
My master's thesis focused on devloping a sound and complete proof system for a new logical formalism, dependency stochastic Boolean satisfiability (DSSAT).
