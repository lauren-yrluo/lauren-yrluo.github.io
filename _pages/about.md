I am a second-year CSE PhD student at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Karem Sakallah](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~karem/).
I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in ECE from the National Taiwan University, 
during which I was advised by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).
My research interests are software/hardware model checking, satisfiability (SAT, QBF, SMT), proof systems and proof complexity. 
I currently work on formal verification for distributed protocols.
