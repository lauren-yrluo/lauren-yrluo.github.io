I am a second-year CSE PhD student at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Karem Sakallah](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~karem/).
I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in ECE from the National Taiwan University, 
during which I was advised by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).

Research Interest
======
My research interests are formal verification, automated reasoning, and computational logic.
To me, the most wonderful of my research is building solutions to real-world challenges upon fundamental basis and understanding them.

**Formal verification**
My current research applies automated reasoning techniques to verify safety properties of distributed protocols. 
In the past, I have worked on hardware model checking. 
I am generally interested in formal verification for human designed systems.

**Automated reasoning**
I am also interested in developing high performance software for automated reasoning. 
I have worked on topics related to SAT/QBF solving.

**Computational logic**
Besides developing algorithms,
I am also interested in understanding what makes an algorithm work well in practice despite the problem's complexity.
In particular, I am interested in proof systems and proof complexities.
